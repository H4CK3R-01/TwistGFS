Use the tab 'Text' to encode or decode texts. When there are many possible words, the first word which is found will be printed in the output field. The number behind the word shows how many possible words are found. You can turn off the number in the settings.\n\nTo decrypt or encrypt words, you can go to the tab 'Word'. Every possible word is printed out in the output field. When no word is found, you can switch the word list and maybe then you can find a word.
